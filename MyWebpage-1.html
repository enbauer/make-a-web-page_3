							<li><b>Attribute</b>: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <br>a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity URl /a</li>

				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p><p>HTML elements are usually <b>block-level</b> elements or <b>inline</b> elements. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element, thereby creating a "block". An inline element, however, takes up only as much width as it needs, and does not force new lines.<br><br>
					A block-display element will span the full width of the space available to it, and so will start on a new line in the flow of HTML. The flow will continue on a new line after the block-display element. Some examples of block elements include: div, p, h, ul, ol, and tables.<br><br>
					Inline-display elements donâ€™t break the flow. They just fit in with the flow of the document. Examples of inline elements include: span, a, strong.<br><br>
					Those are the quick descriptions of inline and block elements. To read about them in more detail, head over to this article at <a href="http://webdesignfromscratch.com/html-css/css-block-and-inline/"> webdesignbyscratch.com</a>

				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p>
						CSS (which stands for Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the appearance and formatting of your HTML.<br><br>
						A style sheet is a file that describes how an HTML file should look.<br><br>
						We say these style sheets are cascading because the sheets can apply formatting when more than one style applies.

				<div class="concept-title">Why Separate Form from Function?
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p> 
						There are two main reasons for separating your form/formatting (CSS) from your functional structure (HTML):
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li>You can apply the same formatting to multiple HTML elements without rewriting code over and over again. </li>
							<li>You can apply similar appearance and formatting to several HTML pages from a single CSS file</li>
						</ul>
				</div>

			<div class="concept" id="lesson-3.3">
				<div class="concept-title">Box Models
				</div>
				<div class="concept-description">
					<p> As discussed earlier, HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The <b>margin</b> is the space around the element. The larger the margin, the more space between our element and the elements around it. We can adjust the margin to move our HTML elements closer to or farther from each other.</li>
						<li>The <b>border</b> is the edge of the element. It's what we've been making visible every time we set the border property.</li>
						<li>The <b>padding</b> is the spacing between the content and the border. We can adjust this value with CSS to move the border closer to or farther from the content.</li>
						<li>The <b>content</b> is the actual "stuff" in the box. If we're talking about a element, the "stuff" is the text of the paragraph.</li>
					</ul>
